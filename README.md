## MindArc Task

# Tasks

* Upload the CSV file to the database.
* Transform and copy the data from one table to another.
* Upload selected image and save the path to the selected row. 

# Files

Included in this PR is all the deliverables along with a db.php file to isolate the db config from the rest of the code.
I have tried to keep the code clean and minimal.

# Design Decisions

* Made use of SQL Query as the tasks focus on database interactions.
* Used OOP as opposed to Procedural Programming for maintainablility.

# Further Actions

Given the time constraint, I have written this app to complete the given tasks. However, few updates can be implemented.

* Data validation for image.
* Gracefully show errors on database errors.


__Thanks for reading! I enjoyed working on the app.__
